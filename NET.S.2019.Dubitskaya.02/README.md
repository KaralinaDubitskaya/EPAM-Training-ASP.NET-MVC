# Day 02
### EPAM-Training-ASP.NET-MVC

##### Tasks:
1. Implement the **InsertNumber** method which gets two integer numbers and two positions of bits i and j (i <j). The algorithm inserts bits of one number into another so that the bits of the second number take positions from bit j to bit i (bits are numbered from right to left). Add NUnit and (!) MS Unit Test to test the method.

2. Implement the **FindNextBiggerNumber** method, which takes a positive integer and returns the closest largest integer consisting of the digits of the original number, and - 1 if no such number exists. Add NUnit or MS Unit tests.

3. Add to the **FindNextBiggerNumber** method the ability to return the time of finding in some different ways. Add NUnit or MS Unit tests.

4. Implement the **FilterDigit** method which accepts a list of integers and filters the list so that only numbers containing the specified digit are left. Do not use LINQ! For example, for the number 7, FilterDigit (7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 68, 69, 70, 15, 17) -> {7, 70, 17}. Add NUnit or MS Unit tests.

5. Implement the **FindNthRoot** algorithm, which allows calculating the nth root (n ∈ N) using the Newton method with a given precision. Add NUnit or MS Unit tests.
