### Tasks:                                                                                                            
**1. Polynomial class.**                                                                                                           
   Implement an immutable `Polynomial class` for working with polynomials from one variable (use the _sz-array_ as the internal structure for storing coefficients).                              
   
   For developed class                                                                                                           
- override the virtual methods of the `Object` class;
-  overload operations allowed for working with polynomials (except the division of a polynomial by a polynomial), including `==` and `!=`.                                        
                                                                                                           
Add unit tests.                                                                                                                                                                              
                                                                                                           
**2. Bubble sort for jagged arrays**                                                                                                           
Implement a `bubble sort` algorithm for jagged integer arrays (do not use sorting methods of the System.Array class), so that it would be possible to order the rows of the matrix:      
- in ascending (descending) order by _sum_ of matrix row elements;                                                                                                           
- in ascending (descending) order of _maximum_ elements of matrix rows;                                                                                                           
- in ascending (descending) order of _minimum_ elements of matrix rows;                                                                                                                                   
                                                                                                           
Add unit tests.
