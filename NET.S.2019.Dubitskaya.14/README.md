### EPAM-Training-ASP.NET-MVC                                                                                                           
                                                                                                           
### Tasks:                                                                                                            

1. Develop a generic class **Queue collection** that implements the basic operations for working with the queue and allows iteration by implementing an “manually” iterator (without using the yield block iterator). Test the methods of the developed class.
2. Create generic classes for representing **square, symmetric and diagonal matrices** (a symmetric matrix is ​​a square matrix that matches a transposed matrix; a diagonal matrix is ​​a square matrix whose elements outside the main diagonal certainly have element type default values). Implement in the created classes an event that occurs when the matrix element with indices (i, j) changes. Extend the functionality of the existing class hierarchy by adding the ability to add two matrices of any type. Add unit tests.
3. Develop a generic class **BinarySearchTree**. Provide an option to use custom sort order. Implement three ways for traversing the tree: Inorder, Preorder and Postorder. Use  _yield_  to define an iterator.
Test with the following types:
    -   System.Int32 (default and custom comparers),
    -   System.String (default and custom comparers),
    -   custom class Book with a defined sort order for its instances (default and custom comparers),
    -   custom struct Point without a defined sort order for its instances (custom comparer).
